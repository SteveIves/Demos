Platforms:    All platforms

Requirements: Synergy/DE V8.3.1a and higher.

              Because of peculiarities in the way in which the USPS have
              chosen to expose their web services, these examples rely on
              several enhancements which were included in the 8.3.1a patch.
              The examples WILL NOT WORK RELIABLY on ANY earlier version.
