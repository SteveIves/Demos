The steps to get this WindowsPhone UI working are:

1. Add a reference to your Core PCL project
2. Create a Setup.dbl file
3. Change App.Xaml.dbl so that it creates a 'new Setup(RootFrame)' during its constructor 

    data setup, @Setup, new Setup(RootFrame)
    setup.Initialize()

4. Change App.Xaml.dbl so that it intercepts the first navigation:

    private method Application_Launching, void
        sender, @Object 
        e, @LaunchingEventArgs 
        endparams
    proc
        RootFrame.Navigating += RootFrameOnNavigating
    endmethod

    private method RootFrameOnNavigating, void
        sender, @Object 
        args, @NavigatingCancelEventArgs 
        endparams
    proc
        args.Cancel = true
        RootFrame.Navigating -= RootFrameOnNavigating
        lambda lambda1()
        begin
            Cirrious.CrossCore.Mvx.Resolve<Cirrious.MvvmCross.ViewModels.IMvxAppStart>().Start()
        end
        RootFrame.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke(lambda1)
    endmethod
	

5. Add a Views folder - it must be called "Views" - and in this place a view - xaml.dbl and .xaml
  - Change the inheritance of this Page to MvxPhonePage in both the Xaml and the Xaml.dbl files
  - Add some XAML for the content pane - e.g. <TextBlock Text="{Binding Hello}" />
