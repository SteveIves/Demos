The steps to get this Store UI working are:

1. Add a reference to your Core PCL project
2. Create a Setup.dbl file
3. Change App.Xaml.dbl so that it creates a 'new Setup(RootFrame)' during its OnLaunched:

    protected override method OnLaunched, void
        args, @LaunchActivatedEventArgs 
        endparams
    proc
        data rootFrame, @Frame, ^as(Window.Current.Content, Frame)
        
        ;; Do not repeat app initialization when the Window already has content,
        ;; just ensure that the window is active
        if (rootFrame == ^null)
        begin
            ;; Create a Frame to act as the navigation context and navigate to the first page
            rootFrame = new Frame()
            if (args.PreviousExecutionState == ApplicationExecutionState.Terminated)
            begin
                ;; TODO: Load state from previously suspended application
            end
            
            ;;  Place the frame in the current Window
            Window.Current.Content = rootFrame
        end
        
        if (rootFrame.Content == ^null)
        begin
            ;; When the navigation stack isn't restored navigate to the first page,
            ;; configuring the new page by passing required information as a navigation
            ;; parameter
            data setup, @Setup, new Setup(rootFrame)
            setup.Initialize()
            
            data start = Cirrious.CrossCore.Mvx.Resolve<Cirrious.MvvmCross.ViewModels.IMvxAppStart>()
            start.Start()
        end
        
        ;; Ensure the current window is active
        Window.Current.Activate()
        
    endmethod


4. Add a views folder and a view - xaml.dbl and .xaml based on BasicPage - this will add 5 files to the Common folder. 
  - Change the Common/LayoutAwarePage.dbl inheritance to Cirrious.MvvmCross.WindowsStore.Views.MvxStorePage
  - Change the Common/LayoutAwarePage.dbl - remove the OnNavigatedTo and OnNavigatedFrom handlers
  - Add some content for your Xaml - e.g. <TextBlock Grid.Row="1" Text="{Binding Hello}" />
