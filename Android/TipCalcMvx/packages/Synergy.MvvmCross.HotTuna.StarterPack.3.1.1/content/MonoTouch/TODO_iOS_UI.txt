NOTE 
- Touch won't currently build from the PC as Xamarin.iOS is currently in the lab under development.
- To make it build on the Mac you will need to substitute the 'real PCLs' with versions built using Xamarin.iOS on the Mac

The steps to get this Touch UI working are:

1. Add a reference to your Core PCL project
2. Create a Setup.dbl file
3. Modify AppDelegate.dbl to create the new Setup and to call the IMvxAppStart
4. Add a views folder and a view - dbl - change the UIViewController inheritance to MvxViewController
5. Edit the ViewDidLoad in the dbl to add a bound control - e.g:


    public override method ViewDidLoad, void
        endparams
    proc
        View = new UniversalView()
        parent.ViewDidLoad()

        data uiLabel, @Object, new UILabel(new RectangleF(0, 0, 320, 100))
        View.AddSubview(uiLabel)
        
        lambda lambda1(vm)
        begin
            vm.Hello
        end
        this.CreateBinding(uiLabel).To<FirstViewModel>(lambda1).Apply()
        
        ;; Perform any additional setup after loading the view
        
    endmethod

This code requires the following imports:

    import YourNameSpace.Core.ViewModels
    import Cirrious.MvvmCross.Binding.BindingContext
    import Cirrious.MvvmCross.Touch.Views
